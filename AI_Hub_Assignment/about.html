                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2020, PDF Tools Suite started as a small project to address the lack of free, high-quality PDF tools available online. Since then, we have grown into a trusted platform used by millions worldwide. Our journey began with a simple PDF merger tool, and over the years, we have expanded our offerings to include a wide range of functionalities such as splitting, compressing, protecting, and converting PDFs.</p>
